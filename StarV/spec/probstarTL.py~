Module: Probabilistic Star Temporal Logic Specification Language

Author: Dung Tran
Date: 12/2/2022

DESCRIPTION:

* This specification language enables quantitative monitoring and verification 
of temporal behaviors of Autonomous CPS and Learning-enabled CPS

* This replies on Probabilistic Star Reachable Set

* Unlike Signal Temporal Logic (STL) or Linear Temporal Logic, ProbStarTL defines
on a reachable set called reachable set signal, not the traditional signal or trace

* ProbStarTL has similar syntax as STL

* ProbStarTL has quantitative semantics that allows answering the probability of 
a system satisfying a property.

* Unlike STL, Quantitative semantics of ProbStarTL is defined based on probability
